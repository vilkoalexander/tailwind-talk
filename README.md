## How to Use

There are two routes available that provide similar functionality:

    /scss - Implemented with SCSS
    /tailwind - Implemented with Tailwind CSS

The Tailwind version has the ability to switch between Dark and Light themes. The SCSS version does not have this feature due to time constraints and the increased complexity of implementation.
